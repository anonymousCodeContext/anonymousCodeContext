Your task is to generate the complete and correct implementation of the specified function in a file, strictly based on the requirements, the provided code file context, and the dependencies of functions.
Your output should be the fully implemented function code, matching the style and logic of the surrounding context.

Please complete the {function_name} function in the middle of a file without any explanation.The code you generate should put between <code> and </code>.

**For dependencies of functions:**
- The dependencies of the function include all other functions in the file, except for the function that is to be completed.
- Dependencies include cross-file dependencies.

The dependencies of functions are:
```Python
{dependencies}
```

**For the provided code file context:**
- The code context above the function is provided.
- The code context below the function is provided.
- The function signature and requirement is provided.

The contexts above the function are:
```Python
{contexts_above}
```

The contexts below the function are:
```Python
{contexts_below}
```

The code to be completed is:
```Python
{input_code}
```

Completed code:
