Your task is to generate a complete and correct implementation of the `{function_name}` function within a file, strictly following the requirements, the provided code context, and all relevant dependencies.
**Instructions:**
- Only output the fully implemented function code, without any explanation.
- Place your code between <code> and </code>.
- Match the style and logic of the surrounding code context.

**Dependencies:**
- The dependencies of the function include all other functions in the file, except for the function that is to be completed.
- Include dependencies from other files (cross-file dependencies).

The dependencies are:
```Python
{dependencies}
```

**For the provided code file context:**
- The code context above the function is provided.
- The code context below the function is provided.
- The function signature and requirement is provided.

**Code Context:**
```Python
{contexts_above}
```

The contexts below the function are:
```Python
{contexts_below}
```

Function to be completed:
```Python
{input_code}
```

Completed code:
